This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and you try to render a component that is not a React component within the `renderItem` function.  For example, passing a plain object or a primitive data type directly to `renderItem` will trigger this error.  

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }]}
  renderItem={({ item }) => item}
/>
```

This code attempts to render the object `{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }` directly, which is invalid.  React Native expects a React component to be returned.
